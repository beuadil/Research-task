##  Research Project: AI-Powered SEO Content Production

### Topic chosen

**AI-powered SEO content production** — how practitioners use AI tools to research, write, optimize, and scale SEO content while maintaining quality and rankings.

I chose this topic because it sits at the intersection of two areas that are changing fast at the same time: AI writing tools and search engine algorithms. The playbook for doing this well is still being figured out in public, which makes it the right time to study who is doing it seriously.
